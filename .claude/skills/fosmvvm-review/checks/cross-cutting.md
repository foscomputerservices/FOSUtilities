# Cross-Cutting Checks

Concerns that span multiple FOSMVVM areas. This check file always triggers when scope is non-empty (regardless of which areas the diff touches).

## Reviewer Guidance

- Silent failure is never acceptable. Every error path must either propagate, log structurally, or surface to the user. "We'll handle it later" is the path to production bugs.

## Check: no-silent-failure
**Severity:** blocker
**What:** Error paths must not silently swallow errors. No empty catches, no `try?` near async device/network calls without explicit handling, no `defer { repaint() }` as the only response to a thrown error.
**Anti-pattern:**
```swift
Task {
    defer { toggleRepaint() }
    try await onPatientSideToggleChanged(viewModel.laterality)
}
```
The `try await` can throw; the `defer` runs but the error vanishes.
**Detection:** Find `try?` adjacent to `await`, empty `catch { }` blocks, and `Task { ... try await ... }` blocks where the only error response is a `defer`. For each hit, verify whether the error is propagated, logged, or surfaced. Flag if not.
