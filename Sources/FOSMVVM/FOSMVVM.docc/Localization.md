# Getting Started With Localization

Patterns and APIs to streamline cross-platform application localization.

## Overview

When writing applications that exclusively use Apple's APIs, [Apple provides Localization APIs](https://developer.apple.com/localization/) that work very well and should be considered as opposed to these APIs.  FOSFoundation's Localization APIs should be considered for applications that have any of the following criteria:

- Require (or desire) localization to be performed on the server instead of the client application
- Swift applications that will run on non-Apple platforms or a combination of Apple and non-Apple platforms (e.g., [WASM Applications](https://swiftwasm.org/), [Vapor Leaf](https://docs.vapor.codes/leaf/getting-started/), [Ignite](https://github.com/twostraws/Ignite), [Skip.tools](https://skip.tools), [Tokamak](https://github.com/TokamakUI/Tokamak), etc.)

## YAML

The default Localization model uses [YAML](https://yaml.org/) files to store the localized strings.
YAML provides a very rich set of primitives for organizing data.  The ``LocalizableRef`` enum
provides a set of standardized APIs for simplifying the management of an application's YAML
files and for simplifying the mapping of the data in the files to the various M-V-VM components.

> It is very important to note that **all** .yml files in the application will be merged together into a single
> dictionary.  The system automatically merges the Locales, however collisions of keys at the levels below
> the Locale will result in warnings being written to the log and the final mapping result is considered undefined.

## Locale Specification

The top key in any YAML file should be the 'Locale' identifier.  Smart matching is performed so that
the region and script codes may be omitted if they are not needed.  Additionally, the locale string
lookup is case *insensitive*.

### Region Agnostic Specification
```
en:
    text: 'Some Text'
es:
    text: 'AlgÃºn texto'
```

### Region Specific Specification
```
en-us:
    carFrontCover: 'Hood'
en-gb:
    carFrontCover: 'Bonnet'
```

## ViewModel Property Binding

``LocalizableRef`` has direct support for binding between a ``ViewModel``'s property and its YAML value

To use this mechanism, the top key under the Locale key must correspond exactly to the Swift type of the ``ViewModel``.

## ViewModel and Property Wrapper

To simplify ``ViewModel`` specification, property wrappers have been provided for standardized mappings and patterns.

### Simple String Support

```swift
struct MyViewModel: ViewModel {
   @LocalizedString var property

   init() { }
}
```

```yaml
  en:
    MyViewModel:
      property: "My Property"
```

> Note: It is suggested that the file containing the Yaml be the same as the file of the ``ViewModel``, but with the .yml suffix.  Thus, in this example there would be a file *MyViewModel.swift* and a file *MyViewModel.yml*.

### Nested Type Support

In some situations ``ViewModel``s contain nested types that need their properties bound.  The *parentType* parameter
provides support for these situations.  Consider the following ``ViewModel``:

```swift
struct ParentViewModel: ViewModel {
  enum NestedEnum: String {
     case option1
     case option2

     var display: LocalizableString {
         .localized(.init(for: Self.self, parentType: ParentViewModel.self, propertyName: rawValue))
     }
  }
}
```

```yaml
  en:
    ParentViewModel:
      NestedEnum:
        option1: "Option #1"
        option2: "Option #2"
```

### Multiple Value support

At times there are situations where having multiple values associated with a property can be handy.  For these cases,
there are two ways to identify such values: **Key Discriminator**s and **Index Discriminator**s.

#### Key Discriminator

A key discriminator expects a dictionary under the property name key in the YAML.

##### Example

```swift
struct UserViewModel: ViewModel {
     @LocalizedString("property", discriminatorKey: "shortTitle") var shortTitle
     @LocalizedString("property", discriminatorKey: "longTitle") var longTitle
     @LocalizedString("property", discriminatorKey: "display") var property
}
```

```yaml
  en:
    UserViewModel:
      property:
        shortTitle: "Short"
        longTitle: "A Very Long Title"
        display: "Property"
```

#### Index Discriminator

An index discriminator expects an array under the property name key in the YAML.

##### Example

```swift
struct UserViewModel: ViewModel {
     @LocalizedString("property", index: 0) var shortTitle
     @LocalizedString("property", index: 1) var longTitle
     @LocalizedString("property", index: 2) var property
}
```

```yaml
  en:
    UserViewModel:
      property:
        - "Option #1"
        - "Option #2"
        - "Option #3"
```
