# Getting Started with FOSMVVM Form Fields

Quickly define ``FormField``s and bind their values to ``ViewModel`` properties

## Overview

FOSMVVM provides ``FormField``, which  describe how to present and manipulate data in a
way that is understandable to the user.  When combined with a ``FormFieldView``, all
of the heavy (and often tedious and repetitive) code is automatically taken care of
(e.g., proper keyboard layouts, when to allow auto-correct, tagging
the data type so that the OS can suggest data, etc.)

For a complete example of how to use ``FormField``, see the following:

- ``FormFieldModel``
- ``FormField``
- ``ValidatableModel``
- ``FormFieldView``
