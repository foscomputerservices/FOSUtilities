# ``FOSMVVM``

A library that provides support for implementing the **Model-View-ViewModel** pattern between **Swift-based** applications and **Swift-based** web servers.

## Overview

FOSMVVM is a full end-to-end implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, including the following services:

### View Localization
- Strongly Typed
    - The binding between the ViewModel property and the entry in the localization (YAML) file is determined by the name of the swift type and property
- Automatically Verified with no manual testing required
    - All localized properties are automatically tested to ensure:
        - No missing bindings in any locales
        - No unintentional duplicates across locales
        - All localizations are properly formatted

### Resources
- Attach images and other resources to properties of the ViewModel
    - The binding can be managed automatically using the swift type and property name or manually specified using a URL
- Automatically Verified with no manual testing required
- Fully versioned allowing different versions of the resource for different versions of the ViewModel
- Image and Resource bindings can be localized

### Automatic Routing
- Server routes for ViewModel resources are automatically generated and maintained, no manual management naming schemes is code required

### ViewModel Versioning
- Easily support multiple versions of each ViewModel ensuring backwards and forwards compatibility of the ViewModel and all attached resources

## Definitions

In FOS's implementation of the [Model-View-ViewModel](https://w.wiki/4T5B) pattern, we use the following definitions:

- **Model**: A database record stored and retrieved from a store. Typically via [Fluent](https://docs.vapor.codes/fluent/overview/).
- **View**: Typically a User Interface element that is displayed to the application user.  Typically a [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) view.
- **View-Model**: An implementation of ``ViewModel`` (or subtypes) that provides a *View*-specific mapping from one or more **Model**s to an arrangement of data that makes sense for the **View**.  The **ViewModel** is generated by the web server and is fully localized before being transmitted to the client application.
