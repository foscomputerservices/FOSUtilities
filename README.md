There are two libraries provided by the FOSUtilities package:  FOSFoundation and FOSTesting.

## FOSFoundation

FOSFoundation is a library of protocols, patterns, types and routines that I have found generally useful in my projects.

## FOSTesting

FOSTestingUtilities is a package of testing patterns, types and routines that I have found generally useful in my projects.

### Swift Package Manager

FOSUtilities supports the [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/package-manager/).  To include FOSUtilities in your project add the following to your Package.swift file:

```
.package(url: "git@github.com:foscomputerservices/FOSUtilities.git", branch: "main"),
